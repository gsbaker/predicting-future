# What we can expect from the future

After reading a 1922 article titled [“what the world will be like in a hundred years”](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83045774/1922-05-07/ed-1?sp=87), I began to wonder what impactful things we can reasonably expect from our future:

* Till-less shopping
* More high-speed rail
* Mass car ownership will be replaced by huge self-driving taxi services
* A high speed ocean tunnel link between the United States and Great Britain
* Brain implants that can fire neurones—therefore curing paralysis and Alzheimer’s
* The economies of Africa and Asia will be substantially more developed
* Space tourism will be accessible to the masses
* Renewable energy will replace fossil fuels
* Artificial produce
* Decentralisation of currency
* Female President of the United States
* Sophisticated VR technology
* Greater understanding of the human brain
* Small scale colonisation of mars
* Nuclear fusion
* More treatments for cancer
* Instant vaccines for new pathogens
* Importance of the state will further decline
